Our project comprises two distinct machine learning tasks:

-Task A: Gender Classification

Overview: Predict if a face image shows a male or female, despite poor image quality.
Goal: Achieve high accuracy in binary classification using robust models.

-Task B: Face Recognition

Overview: Identify a specific person from a face image among a known group.
Goal: Accurately assign the correct identity, handling variations in images.

The two machine learning tasks, Gender Classification and Face Recognition, have been independently implemented and detailed in separate Jupyter notebooks.
